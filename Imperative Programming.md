# What Is Imperative Programming
Imperative programming is explicitly about the "how" of the program works. Usually found in Python, C#, Assembly language, etc. It is also known as the oldest programming paradigm. It comes from the latin word Imperare, which means command. In this course, we are focusing on Python and the imperative programming of it, as it is easier to understand.

## Types of Imperative Programming Styles
There are three types of imperative programming style. One of which is about structured programming style, which is about limiting or completely avoiding jump statement that makes the code unnecessarily complicated.

There is also the procedural approach, like making the program divided into several sub-tasks, which means it can be used in other programs

The modular programming model is simply by making the program independently different in components to each other, and then combined to make actual software

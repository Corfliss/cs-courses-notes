# What is Programming?
There are a lot of definition the it comes to programming. But to make everything simpler, let's make an analogy. Imagine when you have a friend who can only speaks Mandarin only. While at the same time, you can only speak English. Now, you need an interpreter that makes English understandable to the Mandarin person so that the action of that person can be executed. [^1]

Now, programming is basically the same except this friend is a computer. Although the computer can do many incredible things, the truth is the computer is smart because we gave it sets of instruction. To conclude, programming is the process of giving machines a set of instructions that describe how a program should be carried out. [^2]

If you want to know more about programming, you can check the references below.

# Why Programming?
For starter, programming is the backbone of today's technology. Starting from Internet of Things to Open source program. With learning programming, you will learn the advantage of modifying and improving the code into a better state or even making function that you wish were there before.

Additionally, if you are looking for money, then programming is one of the most on demand skill as the time of writing this. So the salary will be lucrative.

# Ordeal of Programming
To be honest, programming itself can be extremely rewarding when you finally figure out how it works and also extremely distressing when you need to figure out the mistake of the code you work, also known as debugging. But really, the beauty is it: a high-risk and high-reward kind of work. 

On the plus side, you will have the attitude of accepting hard challenge and developing mental resilience towards it. Because some problems can take hours even days to solve. That can be solving as simple as assigning a variable or making a large-scale software. So, if you want to understand more about programming, you need to understand this kind of ordeal first.

There are many programming language out there such as, C++, Java, and Python. But at the end of the day, it is all about how the paradigm of the programming work. After all, there are some similarities among each languages. So, to understand that first and mastering any language will be easier.

# What's Next?
This course notes will be using Python as the primary programming language, although it is encouraged to understand and compare other similar programming language with Python. The reason of using Python is because it is one of the language that is considered beginner friendly.

With that in mind, happy programming.

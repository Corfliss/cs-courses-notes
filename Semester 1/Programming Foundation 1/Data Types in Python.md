# What is Data Type?
As the name imply, data type is the data that is classified by the behavior of the data. This means that the data is defined by the characteristic of it. For example. There is a 1234 as a number and 1234 as something written. In programming, these two can be refer as numerical type and strings. That is just two examples of data types. Many to come.
In short:
* Classification of data that can be understand by the programming language.
* Consist of many types

# Types of Data
There are many similarities between any two different data types. But most commonly, particularly in Python, it will be defined as these:
* Text, data that can be written when typing something. Example `str`
* Numerical, consist of number that can be counted by the computer, consist of
	* `int`: Integer, consist of whole number, cannot have decimals in it, ranging from from $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$
	* `float`: unlike integer, it is like a natural number with decimals in it. With range from $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$
	* `complex`: a number that consist of imaginary number. For example, a + bj where a and b is integer while j is square of -1
* Sequence type, consist of list of data, including:
	* `list`: mutable list, which means the value can be changed.
	* `tuple`: immutable list, which means the value cannot be changed
* Mapping type, consist of key and value pairs, like `"brand": "Toyota"`
* Boolean type, only true or false as the data.
* And more

There are a lot of resources in the internet that helps with the understanding of more data type. For now, this one is the most common one

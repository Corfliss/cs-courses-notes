# Defining Needs
## What, How, Why
### What
What is needed to accomplish in UX research?
* Understanding user, task, and usage context as a whole
* Results several stable requirements

### How
* Do data collecting
* Do data analysis
* Do "Expression" observation
* Do all of it iteratively 

### Why
* The challenge is the characteristics of each user is different
* Example from Felder-Silverman style of learning. (Google it)

## Requirements
* Requirements needs to clarify, fix, solve, and rescope user needs
	* Input: requirements document
	* Output: Stable user needs
* Requirements is a result of understanding on user needs
* Requirements is hold accountable based on the received data.

# Types of Requirements
##  Gottesdiener & Gorman (2012) 7 Product Dimensions
* User: interact with the product
* Interface: the product connects to users, systems, and devices
* Action: the product provides capabilities for users
* Data: the product includes a repository of data and useful information
* Control: the enforces constraints
* Environment: conforms to physical properties and technology platforms
* Quality attribute: The product has certain properties that qualify its operation and development

## Preece et al. (2019) 6 Types of Requirements
* Functional: What the system can do
* Non-functional
	* Environmental: usage context, physical, social, and organizational
		* Physical aspect: size, lighting, physical shape, etc.
		* Social aspect: file sharing, synced communications, user privacy, etc.
		* Organizational aspect: hierarchy, communication structure, user support, socialization, etc.
		* Technical aspects: compatibility, running environment, etc.
	* Data: How is the type? How it is store?
	* User characteristics: Who is the user? Like checking on
		* Background
			* Nationality
			* Educational background
			* IT perception
			* Expertise
			* Usage frequency
		* Persona
			* User profile characteristics
			* Not real person, but information from real person
			* Cannot be made by guessing
			* Made as alive as possible
	* Usability goal: How effective? Is it easy to learn?
	* User experience goal: How "wow" is it?

# Data Collecting for Requirements
* Interview
	* Can use property like scenario and prototype
	* Good in exploring issues
	* Dev can discuss with the users
* Focus Groups
	* Can be about group interview
	* Good to reach agreements about requirements
	* Risk of individual domination exists
* Questionnaire
	* Generally used with other data collecting technique
	* Can gives quantitative and qualitative data
	* Good to answer specific questions from many respondents
* Similar Product Research
	* Good to push requirements-defining
* Direct observation
	* Have a complete picture about the task at hand
	* Good for exploring issues
	* Development team can discuss with the user
* Indirect observation
	* Rarely use for defining requirements
	* Good for logging task that has been done
* Studying documentation
	* Procedure and rules often written on documentation
	* Use when stakeholder don't have enough time
	* Good source for understanding certain task

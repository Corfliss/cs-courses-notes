# What is Cognition?
According to Norman(1993)[^1] there are two general modes of cognition: experiental and reflective. Both are essentials for everyday life.

## Experiental Cognition
### A state of mind in which we 
* perceived
* act
* react

### Characteristics
* to vents around us effectively and effortlessly. 
* Requires a certain level of expertise and engagement 

### Example
* driving a car 
* reading a book 

### Source: (Preece, Rogers, and Sharp, 2007, p.94)

## Reflective Cognition
### Involves
* Thinking
* Comparing
* Decision-making

### Purpose
* Leads to new ideas and creativity

### Example
* Designing
* Learning
* Writing a book

### Source: (Preece, Rogers, and Sharp, 2007, p.94)

# Cognitive-involving Activity
According Eysenck and Brysbaert (2018)[^2] there are 6 processes for cognition

## Attention
Attention is about being selective with information as center of concentration.

### Attention-affecting Factor
* Information representation
* Goal

### Tips for Attention
* Grouping the information into chunks
* Assert borders and spaces for grouping
* Proper readability
* Faster information selection
* [8 Golden rules of design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/shneiderman-s-eight-golden-rules-will-help-you-design-better-interfaces) relation: Reduce short term memory load

### Attention Implication on Design
* Consider the context
* Techniques on visual interface for attracting attention
* Avoid overcontent
* Effective interface switching

## Perception
### What Is It?
* Finding meaning or understanding on a certain information.
* User needs to understand the retrieved information
* To decide whether the information is needed or not.

According to [8 Golden rules of design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/shneiderman-s-eight-golden-rules-will-help-you-design-better-interfaces), it is related to offering informative feedback and designing dialogue to yield closure

### Perception Implication in Design
According to Preece et al. (2015) the implication is this:
* Distinguishable icon and graphical representation
* Use separator and white space
* Distinguishable audio layer
* Proper color contrast
* Distinguishable haptic feedback

## Memory
It is defined as internalizationn and externalization of information

### Memory-related Issues
* Unable to remember everything
	* Information selected and compared
	* Relating with previous knowledge
* Needs context
	* Affects memory recall
* Easier to recognize than to recall
	* Brain's depth processing
	* For recall in long-term storage recall

### Memory Implementation Example
* Command Line Interface for command history
* Search history for recognize purpose

### 8 Golden Rules Relation
* Strive for Consistency
* Reduce short-term memory load

### Memory Implication on Design
* Reduce cognitive load
* Use consistent icons, menus, patterns, and placements
* Facilitate information labeling
	* Folder
	* Category
	* Color
	* Tag
	* Timestamp
	* Icon

## Learning (Or Pembelajaran in Bahasa)
Accumulation of skills and knowledge

### Types of Learning
* Incidental Learning: learning without intention
	* Face-memorizing
	* Object-recognizing
* Intentional Learning: Goal-directed learning
	* Learning this with goals
	* Learning academic stuff

### Learning Implication on Design
* Encourage exploration
* Giving constraints and hints

## Linguistic
Talk, listen, read

### Linguistic Implication on Design
According to Preece et al. (2015):
* Minimal speech-based menu or instruction
* Clear sound feedback
* Facilitate font size resize option without affecting formatting

## Metacognition
Planning, decision-making, problem-solving

### Definition
* Awareness and understanding of one's on thought processes

### Metacognition Implication on Design
* Provide manual page
* Facilitate preference information storage

# Mental Model

## Definition and Understanding 
* Internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made (Craik, 1943)
* Mental model helps representing a phenomena.
* Many phenomenas can be represented by a mental model.

## Example
* Supply and demand for how economy works
* Loss aversion for how humans avoids loss

## Mental Model Issue
### Accuracy
* Many phenomenas generalization using only a mental model.

### Similarities
* Limited to perception and knowledge of the mental model maker

### Depth
* Unable to represent in details that fits the real phenomena if the phenomena is too specific.

## Distributed Cognition
* Knowledge and cognitive process doesn't happen inside the head, but as a result of many obects, humans, artifacts, or nearby items.

## External Cognition
* How humans interact with the external representation (map, diagrams) and function to reduce memory laod (shopping list, deadline reminder)

## Computational Offloading
* The needs to externalize cognition like pen and paper for shopping list.

## Annotation
* Involving change of representation that appears by giving a mark like checklist or highlights.

## Cognitive Tracing
* Involving component manipulation to represent in a new order, like moving "job done" to the bottom list of the app.

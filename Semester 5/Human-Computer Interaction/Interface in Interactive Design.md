# UI, Usability, and UX
## User Interface
* The visual design of the interface

## Usability
* How the visual is being used by the user
* Can the users accomplish their goals?

# User Experience
* How the user think and feel when using the application
* Did the user have a delightful experience as high as possible?

# Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design
1. Consistency
2.  Shortcuts
3. Informative Feedback
4. Dialogue to Yield Closure
5. Simple Error Handling
6. Easy Reversal
7. Support Internal Locus of Control
8. Reduce Short Term Memory Load

# Kinds of Interface
1. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
	* Require the user to type in commands at a prompt symbol appearing in the display
	* The commands are typically abbreviations
	* Nowadays, command-line interface (CLI) were generally superseded by the graphical user interface (GUI)
	* Desigining CLI
		* The form of the commands (e.g., the use of abbreviations, full names, familiar names, etc.)
		* Syntax (e.g., how best to combine commands)
		* Organization (e.g., how best to structure options)
		* Consistency in commands labelling/naming

2. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
	* Design considerations
		* Window design: window management
		* Menu design
		* Icon design

3. Voice User Interface (VUI)
	* User command and conversation interactionn type where users speak and listen to the interface rather than click, tap, swipe, or push it
	* Can involve proactive system when the system initiates the interaction
	* Design considerations
		* How to design it as natural as possible (more human-like)
		* How to design it to help users navigate easily (e.g., to recover/escape from errors/mishearings, etc.)
		* How to design it to guide users who give vague or ambiguous commands\

4. Haptic Interface
	* Use tactile feedbacks by applying vibrations and forces to the user using actuators embedded in a device or user’s clothing
	* Design considerations
		* Determining the place of the actuators
		* Determining what will activate the haptic feedbacks
		* Determining how high is the intensity of the haptic feedbacks
		* Avoid annoying experiences :/

5. Augmented and Mixed Reality
	* Augmented Reality (AR) adds digital elements (augmentation) to a live view using cameras
	* Mixed Reality (MR) combines virtual and augmented realities elements (example: Microsoft Hololens)
	* Design considerations
		* Determining the form of the digital augmentation
		* Determining when and where the digital augmentation will appear
		* Avoid distraction by the digital augmentation objects
		* Design digital augmentation that is simple and align with real-life objects

6. Virtual Reality
	* A complete immersion of one’sexperience from the physical world. It can involves an imagined or real-world environment 
	* Design considerations
		* Enhance the feeling of presence with virtual-self body
		* Prevent simulator sickness from galvanic stimulation
		* Designing effective navigation
		* Determine how best the user will interact with the elements in the VR

7. Robot and Drones Design
	* Design considerations
		* Whether anthropomorphism (e.g., designed as human as possible in appearance) of robots should be encouraged
		* Whether using unmanned drones to capture images of private properties and people without consent is ethical

8. Wearable
	* Some consideration in wearable design
		* A core design concern: Comfort
		* Consider designing a light, small, and fashionable device
		* Consider issues related to hygiene: Is it possible to wash the device?
		* Consider how the user control the device

9. Appliances
	* Appliances
	* Design considerations
		* Need to be considered as transient: short time interactions
		* Avoid unnecessary array of buttons or objects that could confuse
		* Emphasize on simplicity and visibility

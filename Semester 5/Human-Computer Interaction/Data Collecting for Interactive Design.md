### Relationship with Participant
* Participant must be aware and **consent** to provide data
* Example

	* Will there be incentive?

### Data Triangulation
* Findings can be **reinforced** with data collecting.
* Example
	* Where is the source?
	* What method/structure the theory is being used?
	* What is the data collector?

### Pilot Studies
* Determining feasibility and instrument validation through small study
* Example
	* Is the study statistics readable and reliable?
	* Is the study statistics valid?

## Type of Data
### Qualitative Data
* Interview transcript
* Qualitative analysis spreadsheet
* Interview findings
* Persona

### Quantitative Data
* UEQ questionaire

* Questionnaire response recap

# Data Collecting Method
## Think Aloud Method

* UX researcher only act as a facilitator

### Pros
* Cheap
* Flexible
* Robust

	* Defining how to get acceptance
	* Defining how to handle sensitive issue?
* Observing ethnography
* Data to be collected
	* What is data to collect?
	* What is the tool?
	* When to stop observing?
* Using think aloud method
#### Controlled environment observation
* Did in a controlled environment
* Using think aloud method
* You can use web analytics
#### Indirect observation
* Can be diary, log, interaction, video, etc.

## Usability Testing Method
### Characteristics
* User asked to test a prototype and the the behavior is recorded
* UX researched acts as test moderator only

### Pros
* Provide qualitative feedback
* Measuring behavior
* Focus on the urgent feature by the real user.

## Interview Method

#### Unstructured
* Unscripted, free, and flexible

### Interview Flow
* Introduction
* Warm up session
* Main body
* Closing

### Format
* Yes/no

* Rating
* Open ended response

### Pros

* Quick response
* Cheaper
* Easy data entry
* Faster analysis
* Easier correction

### Cons
* Can be problematic if population size is unknown
* Need to avoid duplicate
* Need to avoid anser change

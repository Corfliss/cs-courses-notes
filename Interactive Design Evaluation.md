# Why Evaluation?
* Ensure the product can help to achieve user needs and expectation
* IT produk needs to evaluated and iterated as regular as possible
* IT growth is fast, so it needs to be updated often
## What, Where, When?
### When
* Formatively, which means on a time window?
* As summative as possible, which means according to the success of the product?

### On What
* On prototype?
* On fully functioning system?

### Where
* Natural settings?
* Controlled lab?

# Types of Interactive Design Evaluation
## Natural Settings
* Observe the prototype of the system directly on the field
* Get the gist for new interactive design
* To evaluate initial idea for interactive design
* Output: user feedback, design suggestion

## Controlled Lab
* On a controlled environment
* System usability testing on a simulation
* Difficult to test complex system on conventional lab

### Usability Testing
* User asked to do certain task to simulate system usage
* UX researcher only acts as facilitator
* Generally, it is recorded and analyzed on certain parameter
* Can use System Usability Scale or User Experience Questionnaire
* See [[Analysis, Interpretation, and Data Presentation]] for more info about that

## Without Direct User Involvements
* Getting insight from expert (UX researcher)
* Insight is for the developed interactive design
* Similar to Genius Design concept on [[Interactive Design Process]]
* Might be biased and invalid because not involving users directly

# Challenge in Evaluation
## User Agreements and Rights
* UX researcher obliged to tell the purpose, reason of research, risk and rights of the participant
* UX researcher created informed consent form that is approved by the participant
* The informed consent form is a user legal approvement document

## Other Issues
* Reliability
* Validity
* Ecological Validity
* Biases
* Scope

# Tips for Usability Testing
* User asked to do certain task without knowing how to do it
* Session recorded and behavior observed
* Time completion is recorded too
* Controlled settings to simulate system usage
* Data obtained used for design error on design or user difficulty
* Questionnaire filling can be added to the testing
# Field Study

# Additional Info
## Heatmap
* To pinpoint frequent eyes interaction from the user.
* Can be replaced with click or tap of the device
* Can be used for session sampling
* Giving visualization on interface with highest interaction frequency
* Can be helping to evaluate whether the interface is easy to understand or not

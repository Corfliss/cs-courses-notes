# Internet: Views and Protocols
For the focus of this topic, it will focus on the engineering view of it and service views.

## Engineering and Service Views
### Engineering View: Components of Internet
* Host: the end systems, running apps at Internet's "edge"
	* PC
	* Phone
	* Anything IoT
* Packet switches: forward packets, a chunks of data.
	* Router
	* Switches
* Communication links: with bandwith
	* Fiber
	* Copper
	* Radio
	* Satellites
* Networks: collection of devices, routers, links
* Internet: networks of networks
* Protocols
	* HTTP (Web)
	* TCP
	* IP
	* etc.
* Internet standards
	* RFC: Request for comments
	* IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

### Service View:
* Infratstructure: for service of the applications
	* Web
	* Video-streaming
	* Multimedia
	* etc.
* Programming Interface: to distributed platforms
	* "Hooks" for allowing/receiving apps
	* Service options

## Networks Protocols
* Analagous to a human asking 
	* "what is this place?"
	* "what time is it?", 
* It is about governing the activity in the internet
	* How to sent a specific message
	* How to do certain actions

So the definition is this[^1]:
* Protocols defines 
	* format, 
	* order of message sent received among network entities
	* action taken on message transmission and receipt

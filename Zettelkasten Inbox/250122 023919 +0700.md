# Why to use SerializeField?
To make sure that private variable to show up in the editor.

# Why to use awake() rather than start()?
~~Because awake() is rendered before the frame start, while start() is starting from the first frame.~~

Actually, I'll just refer that to [here](https://gamedevbeginner.com/start-vs-awake-in-unity/) so that you can decide on your own.

# Welcome to CS Courses Notes by Corfliss
Hello and welcome to this vault, it is a delighful to have you here.

## About Me
My name is Fauzan Hanandito, although you might know me better as Corfliss. At the time I am writing this note. I am in a semester break between semester 5 and 6. My major is in computer science at Universitas Indonesia. In this vault, you will find the resources of everything I learned in my major that I made during my livestream at [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/corfliss).

## Reason of Doing This
To make it simple and easy to remind in case if I forget: ==To reinforce my knowledge by sharing.== As far as I learned about learning, the best way to learn something is to create what have we learned. In this case, I made a notes that is, with God will, balanced between easy to understand and comprehensive to dive in. Hopefully in the process, this also help others learn from my own experience, knowledge, and mistakes.

## How The Vault is Documented
The vault will be documented in each semester according to the mandatory syllabus of International Undergraduate Program for computer science major of Universitas Indonesia. There are 5 semesters for the mandatory courses and each will contain 5 courses.

## Permission To Share
You have the right to share this vault to anyone, however, attribution is required in case if there are people with malicious intent to copy and paste the work and then making it their own.

## Final Note
As in the culture of gaming: GLHF (Good luck, have fun).

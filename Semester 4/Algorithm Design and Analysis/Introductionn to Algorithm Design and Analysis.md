# Introduction
This course will teach you on how to design and analyze algorithms for solving given problems. This include the correctness and the complexity of the algorithms

* Growth of functions
* Algorithm analysis: worst case, average case, best case
* Divide and conquer
* Another algorithm introduction: quicksort, mergesort
* Recurrence relation: master method, method of substitution recursion tree
* Lower bound of comparison based sorting
* Linear sorting
* Another algorithm introduction: heapsort, bucket sort, radix sort, counting sort
* Order statistics: selection problem
* Dynamic programming: LCS, matrix-chain multiplication
* Greedy algorithm: fractional knapsack, job scheduling, MST
* Backtracking: 0/1 knapsack
* Backtracking, branch and bound
* Graph algorithms: breadth first search ad depth first search

# What Is Design Process?
## In A Nutshell
* Goal-oriented problem solving activity
	* Formulating interactive design alternative
	* Defining alternative that can be used
* Creative activity
* Decision-making activity

## Double Diamond of Design

# Interactive Design Process Flow
## Main Activity
* Defining needs
* Designing alternative design
* Prototyping
* Interactive design evaluation

# Common Method
## User Centered Design (UCD)
### Definition
* Focusing on the design to fulfill needs and involving user in designing design activity
* Aim to design that is created suitable with the needs and expectations of the product user.

### UCD Principle
* Initial focus on the users and their tasks
* Empirical measurig
* Iterative design

### UCD Flow
1. Establishing User Requirements
	* Background interviews and questionnaires
	* Sequence of work interviews
	* On-site observation
	* Role-playing, walkthroughs, and simulations 
2. Designing Alternative Design
	* Designing information architecture
	* Wireframing
	* Designing interface design
3. Protyping
	* Make clickable mockup
	* Using available prototyping tools
4. Evaluating
	* Usability testing
	* Heuristic evalution
	* Questionnaires (again)
5. Either go to no. 2 or end it by presenting final product

### The Importance of Involving User
* Expectation management
	* To be done so that the user expectation is realistic
	* User don't surprised or dissapointed with the design
* Ownership aspect
	* Make user as active stakeholder
	* High chance that user understan deeper about any appearing issue
	* Defining product acceptance

### Type of User Involvement
1. User enters the designer team
2. Newsletters/Social media

## Genius Design
### Definition
* Method to design an interactive design that relies on expertise, experience, knowledge, and skills of visual design team
* Relying user experience based on assumption and intuition

### When to Use
* Experienced team
* High-confidence on the intuition of ours and other team members
* Highly understand user objective

### When Not to Use (And Rather Use UCD)
* When prediction and measurement of results expected
* When user testing defining certainty in decision making
* When aversing risk
* When time and fund is enough

## Activity Centered Design (ACD)
### Definition
According to Beaumont (2009), it is about:
* Focus on activity of stakeholder product.
* Identifying issue that appears on users.

### ACD Iterative Process
1. Observing: gather data on all of the docs (elements) 
2. Reframing: looking at the dots, see how they connect
3. Converging: viewing the connection, determine which areas need to be solved to be truly successful
4. Experimenting: test the solution until it fits in the centre of innovation

## Design Sprint
### Definition
* Framework to design and test design interactive in 5 days.
* Lead by sprint master from UX researcher and UX designer

### Design Sprint Process Flow
![[Design Sprint Process Flow.png]]

1. Understand: user needs, business, and technology capacities
2. Define: key strategy and focus
3. Diverge: explore as many ideas as possible
4. Decide: best idea so far
5. Prototype: an artifact that allows to test the ideas with users
6. Validate: the ideas with users, business stakeholders, and technical expers.

# Possible Issues
## Who Is Our User?
Not so fast, Ferguso. You need to define:
* People who interacts directly with the product
* People who manages the users directly
* People who gets the product output
* People who decides buying decision
* People who use competitor product.
* Eason (1987) formula of three types of users
	* Primary user: frequent hands-on
	* Secondary user: occasional
	* Tertiary user: Influenced from introduction or influencing product purchase.

## What "Needs" Means?
### Frequent Problems
* User don't know which one viable or not
* User have difficulty to communicate the real needs.

### Observation Task
* Context?
* Needed info?
* Who is collaborating?
* Why the task solution is like this?

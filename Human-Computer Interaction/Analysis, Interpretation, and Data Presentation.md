# Quantitative and Qualitative Data
## Qualitative Data
* Narrative/Artifact
* Hard to expressed with numbers
* E.g.: Dislikeness
* Depticting element characteristics
* Represented with patterns and stories

## Qualitative Data
* Numeric
* Using numeric method to measure certain aspects of a subject.

# Quantitative Analysis
## Simple Quantitative Analysis
* Mean, median, modus
* Percentage
* Graphical representation
* ![[Which Chart To Use.png]]

## Tips For Quantitative Analysis
* Criticize, niching it down to the smallest details
* Ask what data that you want to represent.
* Ask what visual technique that you/your team want to use.

# Qualitative Analysis
## Simple Qualitative Analysis
* Patterns: from emergence
* Categorization: emergence/pre-specified
* Critical incidents: key events

## Example
* Coding scheme
	* Highlight critical keyword
	* Make an open coding themes
	* Categorize from any emerging categories
	* Interpret it
* Affinity Diagram

# Common Usable Tools
* Spreadsheet
* SPSS
* Qualitative Data Analysis Tools
* Nvivo and Atlas.ti
* CAQDAS

# Theoretical Structure for Qualitative Analysis
## Grounded Theory
### Characteristics
* Formulate theory base on data analysis
* Categorization approach (or "coding")
* Three level of coding
	* Open (identification category)
	* Axial (subcategory connecting)
	* Selective (Shaping theoretical schema)
* UX Researchers demanded to ground their analysis on grounded theory

### Data Representation
* Make accountable statements based on the data collected
* Data representation depends on
	* Audience
	* Goal
	* Data collecting technique
	* Data analysis
* Graphical representation can be the right way to do so
* Other techniques
	* Rigorous notation (UML)
	* Storytelling
	* Summary of result

# System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Simple quantitative analysis tools for system usability
* 10 questions regarding usability
* Results 1-10 scale
* The right way to know usability of a system as a whole quickly
* Scale collected can be used as basis of benchmarking

# User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)
* Comprehensive quantitative analysis tools to evaluate system usability
* It has 6 aspects to evaluate
	* Attractiveness
	* Perspicuity
	* Efficiency
	* Dependability
	* Stimulation
	* Novelty
* 27 questions regarding usability
* resulting UEQ scale
* Results can be used to compare quality of many systems
* Results can be used as basis of benchmarking
